# Riemann Surface Covering

Sagemath module for working with (ramified) coverings of Riemann surfaces.

A (ramified) covering of Riemann surfaces is a holomorphic map $f\colon X \to
Y$ between Riemann surfaces. A Galois covering is a covering $\pi_G\colon Z \to
Y$ induced by the action of a group $G$.

The two main classes defined by this module are `Covering` and
`GaloisCovering`; several methods are defined, which give information about the
coverings, such as the genus, the total ramification or the intermediate
coverings.
